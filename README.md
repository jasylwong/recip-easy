## <a name="Objective">Objective</a>

The objective in building this app was to apply what I'd learnt about State and Effect hooks in React. I also wanted to practice the use of an external API (the [EDAMAM recipe API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api)) within a React app.

Additional features that I would like to work on:
